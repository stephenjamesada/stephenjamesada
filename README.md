## Hi, I'm Stephen

Aspiring Software Developer / IT Specialist

**Located in**: St. Louis, Missouri

**Contact**: ada_stephen@proton.me | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-ada-345a06370/) | 
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/stephenjamesada)

**Work Focus**: Python | Go | TypeScript

**Other Languages**: Ruby

> I separated Ruby from the Work Focus languages due to me using Ruby more for hobby projects rather than for professional work... but I may learn Rails later on. As for Go and TS, these are languages that I aim to be professional in, but I need to actually learn them first. I'm good with Python.

## What I Do

I'm an aspiring software developer and IT specialist, learning the languages Python, Go and TypeScript.

Currently enrolled in the [Google IT Support Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support) course provided by Coursera. When I finish, certification proof will be shown below.

> Besides dev, I'll also make repos of my IT labs. Regarding this, my toolset is:

- Graphviz
- GNS3
- CORE
